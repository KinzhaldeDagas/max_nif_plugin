Samples\Modifiers\PointCache

The Point Cache modifier requires the FBX SDK to compile.

Version 2016.1 VS2015 or newer is required, but it is recommended to use the latest versions (2019.2 VS2015 or 2019.2 VS2017), since those versions fix some security issues.
The FBX SDK can be found at www.autodesk.com/fbx
After installing, create two environment variables called FBX_SDK_INC_DIR and FBX_SDK_LIB_DIR that point to the include and library directories of the installed sdk, respectively. For example:
FBX_SDK_INC_DIR=C:\Program Files\Autodesk\FBX\FBX SDK\2019.2\include
FBX_SDK_LIB_DIR=C:\Program Files\Autodesk\FBX\FBX SDK\2019.2\lib\vs2017
